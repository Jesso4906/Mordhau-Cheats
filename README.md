# Mordhau-Cheats

Cheats for Mordhau, including a projectile aimbot and parrybot.

For whatever reason, the developers of Mordhau decided to include the .pdb file of Mordhau-Win64-Shipping.exe in the release of their game. This made reversing it easy, and is how I got the structures and functions in mordhauTypes.h
